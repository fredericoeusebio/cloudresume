## My Progress

### Create a GitHub Repository (Repo)

- Creating a GitHub repo was the first step to complete this challenge both because it is good practice to store your projects in a remote repo and because its a 
widely used source control software used by millions of developers for collaborative purposes and to keep track of work completed. [Please follow the link to 
learn how to create a github repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) 

### Use HTML and CSS to build the website and store the code in the repo

- My resume was written in HTML and styled with CSS. To understand more of both languages I took a course on Pluralsight, which is a paid course however, there are 
a numbers of resources available online at no cost such as: [CSS Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA) and [HTML Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE).
